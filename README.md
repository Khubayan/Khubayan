<!--TEXT-->
<p>
  I'm Khubayan, a self-taught developer currently exploring the world of web development with a focus on backend technologies such as Node.js. My passion for coding started as a hobby and quickly turned into a serious pursuit as I realized the power of technology in solving real-world problems.

Although I'm still in the learning stage, I have gained a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which has helped me in building simple and responsive front-end web pages. My current focus is on enhancing my skills in Node.js and Express.js, as I believe that these technologies are essential for building scalable and performant backend applications.

Apart from coding, I enjoy reading technical blogs and participating in online forums to keep myself updated on the latest trends in the tech industry. I'm also a firm believer in the power of collaboration and enjoy working with like-minded developers to build exciting and innovative projects.
